## What's Aurora?

Aurora is a **study-focused** language that compiles to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It already does basic compilation and runs code via an evaluator, but it's still in the oven: syntax and behavior may shift, and some EVM goodies aren't fully there yet. Perfect for tinkering and learning.

## Get started

### Install CLI

Full install options (including macOS workaround): **[docs/install.md](docs/install.md)**

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| **macOS (Homebrew)** | `brew tap guiferpa/tap && brew install guiferpa/tap/aurora` |
| **Linux (.deb)** | Download from [Releases](https://github.com/guiferpa/aurora/releases) → `sudo dpkg -i aurora_*_linux_*.deb` |
| **Other** | [Releases](https://github.com/guiferpa/aurora/releases) — unpack archive for your OS/arch |
| **From source** | `go install -v github.com/guiferpa/aurora/cmd/aurora@HEAD` (requires [Go](https://go.dev/)) |

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS: “Apple could not verify …” (unverified developer)</strong></summary>

If Gatekeeper blocks the binary, use one of these:

**Terminal (recommended)** — in the folder where the `aurora` binary is:

```sh
xattr -cr aurora
./aurora
```

**Finder:** Right-click the binary → **Open** → **Open** (one-time approval).

The Homebrew cask applies the workaround automatically. More detail: [docs/install.md#macos-apple-could-not-verify--unverified-developer](docs/install.md#macos-apple-could-not-verify--unverified-developer).
</details>

### Try in 30 seconds (no project needed)

Jump straight into the REPL, no project setup:

```sh
aurora repl
```

```java
>> ident a = 1;
>> a + 1;
= 2
>> ident b = true;
>> print b;
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
```

`Ctrl+D` exits; `Ctrl+C` clears the line you're typing. No `aurora.toml` needed for `repl`, `version`, or `help`.

**Line editing and history:** `↑`/`↓` browse previous commands, `←`/`→` move the cursor inside the line (also `Home`/`End` and `Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E`), and `Backspace`/`Delete` edit in place.

History is shared by every project in **`~/.aurora/history`** (last 1000 commands, written as you type them, `0600`). Point `AURORA_HISTORY` somewhere else to change the file. When stdin is not a terminal — e.g. `printf '1 + 1;\n' | aurora repl` — the REPL reads plain lines, with no history and no key handling.

### Project manifest

Most commands (**build**, **run**, **deploy**, **call**) want a project manifest — that's the `aurora.toml` file at your project root (or in a parent folder). It holds stuff like default source and output paths.

If you forget, the CLI will gently remind you:

```
aurora.toml not found in current directory or any parent (run 'aurora init' to create a project manifest)
```

**Create a new project:**

```sh
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
aurora init
```

That drops an `aurora.toml` with `[project]` and `[profiles.main]` (defaults: `source` = `src/main.ar`, `binary` = `bin/main`). From there you can `aurora run`, `aurora build`, etc. The only commands that *don't* need a manifest: `aurora init`, `aurora version`, `aurora help`, `aurora repl`.

Full manifest reference (including optional on-chain bits): [docs/manifest.md](docs/manifest.md).

### Run from file

1. **With a project:** Put your code in `src/main.ar` (or whatever path you set in `aurora.toml`), then from the project root:

   ```sh
   aurora run
   ```

2. **Run any file:** From a dir that has (or inherits) `aurora.toml`:

   ```sh
   aurora run -s path/to/your/file.ar
   ```

Example — save as `src/main.ar`:

```java
ident result = 10 * 20;
print result + 1;
```

Run `aurora run`. The evaluator prints values as raw bytes (here 201 = 8 bytes): `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 201]`.

### Compile to EVM bytecode

Want bytecode instead of running in the evaluator?

```sh
aurora build                              # uses manifest: source -> binary
aurora build -s src/main.ar -o bin/main   # or point to any file and output
```

You get a raw bytecode file — deploy it or feed it to your favorite EVM client. For deploy/call (rpc, privkey, etc.) check the [Manifest reference](docs/manifest.md).

### Writing some code

A few snippets to paste in the REPL or in a file:

```java
ident x = 10;
ident y = 20;
print x + y;           // 30 (as bytes)

ident flag = true;
if flag bigger 0 then 1 else 0;   // if is an expression, returns a value

ident t = [1, 2, 3];   // tape = 8-byte array
print head t 2;
```

For more — tapes, reels, branches, EVM-style callables — dig into the [examples folder](https://github.com/guiferpa/aurora/tree/main/examples) (e.g. `examples/evm/ident.ar`, `examples/simple_math.ar`). What's in and what's not yet: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Language Design

Aurora is **untyped** — everything is bytes; numbers, booleans, tapes (arrays), and strings (reels) are all byte arrays. Full reference:

**[→ Language Design (Untyped, Tapes, Reels, Arithmetic)](docs/language-design.md)**

<details>
<summary>Quick reference</summary>

- **Values** = byte arrays (e.g. `ident a = 3` → 8 bytes; `ident b = [1,2,3]` → 8-byte tape).
- **Tapes**: `pull`, `push`, `head tape n`, `tail tape n`; index `n` is modulo 8.
- **Reels**: strings are arrays of 8-byte tapes (one per character); use `echo` to print.
- **Arithmetic**: first 8 bytes interpreted as unsigned 64-bit integer; booleans padded to 8 bytes (`true`=1, `false`=0).
</details>

## Try it out

### Playground

## Commands

Quick reference: everything except **init**, **version**, **help**, and **repl** wants an `aurora.toml` in the current dir (or a parent). No manifest? Run `aurora init` and you're good.

```sh
aurora help

  build       Build binary from source code
  call        Call program on a blockchain
